The center console’s 20’11” length is matched with an ultra-spacious 98” beam and a high-performance pad hull with 10” manual setback. The entire design is handcrafted for an ultra-smooth ride with responsive handling. Plus, it’s engineered to be right at home in the shallows, instantly jumping on plane while also stalking fish in the skinniest waters. Bow to stern, it’s a roomy rig well-suited for guides and weekend anglers alike.</p><p>Reinforcing that focus, the massive front deck includes a pair of oversized and insulated, fiberglass storage boxes. Each is equipped with compression latches and raised lips, helping seal out the rawest of weather. Balancing both sides of the forward deck are two additional 8 ½’ rod compartments with oval-entry, closed-end tubes. A built-in, insulated cooler serves double duty as a step to the deck and can also be ordered as an additional livewell/baitwell. The center console is equipped with undercut toe-kicks, rod holders, floor lighting, a host of performance instrumentation, and plenty of room for today’s larger, flush-mounted electronics.</p><p>On the rear deck, the huge fiberglass livewell includes recirculating aeration, an anti-splash ring, and pump-out. Looking farther aft, the rear power compartment showcases a neat, clean, and wide-open interior arranged for easy access to pumps and other equipment. The stern of the 2180cc also includes a full transom with no splash well. It’s a custom-engineered feature creating even more space on the rear deck while delivering the ultimate platform to work fish side to side and bow to stern.
