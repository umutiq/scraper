Our reinforced splash fins, stainless steel mid-back reclining helm chairs, and our one of a kind v-lite performance deck makes the Trifecta LE not so \"entry-level\" compared to others.</p><strong>Features may include:</strong><ul><li>(4) Speakers w/ Protective Inside Covers</li></ul><ul><li>27 Gallon, Direct Fill, Fuel Tank in Motor Pod w/ Fuel / Water Separator</li></ul><ul><li>3/4\" One Piece V-Lite Performance Deck</li></ul><ul><li>Bimini Top Trailering Brackets</li></ul><ul><li>Bow Reinforcement Bumper &amp; Continuous Extruded Aluminum Riser Brackets</li></ul><ul><li>Clarion Radio</li></ul><ul><li>Deutsch Waterproof Electrical Wiring Harness</li></ul><ul><li>Exterior \"D\" Rail Design</li></ul><ul><li>LED Navigation Lights</li></ul><ul><li>Port Side Cup Holder (RF Models)</li></ul><ul><li>Radius Deck w/ Integrated Deck Trim and Vinyl Rub Rail</li></ul><ul><li>Raised Logos</li></ul><ul><li>Reinforced Splash Fins</li></ul><ul><li>Stainless Steel Cleats and Rail Braces</li></ul><ul><li>Stainless Steel Rimmed Cupholder - One in helm</li></ul><ul><li>Steel Framed Mid Back Reclining Helm Chair w/ Arms &amp; Headrest</li></ul><ul><li>Stern Platform w/ SS Telescoping Ladder</li></ul><ul><li>Stern Stainless Steel Corners</li></ul><ul><li>Surlast 10' Color Matched Bimini Top w/ Push Pin Quick Release</li></ul><ul><li>Surlast Color Matched Playpen Cover (Factory Installed)</li></ul><ul><li>Tachometer, Voltmeter, Fuel Gauge, Trim Gauge, 12 Volt Receptacle</li></ul><ul><li>Transducer Bracket on Starboard Tube</li></ul><ul><li>Vinyl Wrapped Furniture Bases</li></ul>\t\t\t  ","images":["https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/04/71/0471EDA2-87DB-4558-9313-B39068BC84B9.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/82/E8/82E81712-66EB-4A4E-A48B-E00AF529C785.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/30/E5/30E564AD-825A-4F3F-8CDD-3A1C1A3D818E.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/C4/4B/C44BF4BF-D864-4F30-BD91-1A0F9D125214.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/18/12/18124421-D2A3-43B4-88F8-EED589F1086C.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/45/1E/451E85A5-A4BB-4682-942A-39831AD96B8A.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/CC/C4/CCC49C77-374E-44BD-9BCD-47B668B7207F.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/4F/77/4F77CC72-BC6C-4AB6-94AC-C6F9F322E042.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/B5/58/B558A1AF-A903-4B52-8124-FBB3276153E2.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/80/AF/80AFE936-2594-4C99-8754-86C6C1640F2A.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/25/E9/25E982E8-59A2-47C2-86C5-CD699FACC761.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/C7/5B/C75B3D13-7034-4EAF-B601-53DB3C8C8ECE.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/52/FD/52FD5A34-139C-4ECB-9A89-1ABA054AF2C3.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/51/43/51433B5E-C429-4D5C-8E12-643E7C86A099.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/8B/98/8B9891C9-2598-4985-9D76-6CCECA068AB7.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/D5/42/D5423460-E3B5-498E-8673-83A51D920FFE.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/C5/A8/C5A8C101-2A5C-4380-851B-C701FC110461.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/FC/9B/FC9B1C40-A68F-4869-923F-332C39171ECE.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/72/D2/72D27458-F180-4C73-83DA-E3B6742CC402.jpg","https://cdn.dealerspike.com/imglib/v1/800x600/imglib/Assets/Inventory/35/38/353809EC-6E9F-491A-945C-837DC3E2AC17.jpg"]},{"specs":{"location":"New Braunfels","condition":"New","stockNumber":"TF8165","year":"2023","make":"Trifecta","model":"23RF SS 25\"","vehicleType":"Boat","category":"Pontoon / Tritoon","vIN":"FRUA8165G223","propulsion":"Single Outboard","hullIdNumber":"FRUA8165G223","lOA(Length)":"23 ft","propulsionType":"Powered","pontoonLength":"23 ft","color":"BLUE"},"manufacturerInfo":{"overallLength":"24'","length":"Deck: 24'","width":"8'6\"","dimensions":"Tube Diameter: 25\"","seatingCapacity":"12 persons","weight,MaximumCapacity":"1725 lbs","weight":"2080 lbs","enginePower":"Max: 400 hp"},"name":"2023 Trifecta 23RF SS 25\"","price":"$85,999","description":"                                    \n<h3>2023 Trifecta 23RF SS 25\"</h3><p>Here you'll discover the direct result of what happens when we listen to what our customer's demand in a luxury performance pontoon boat line.

looks to its tournament-bred engineering and incredibly-long list of standard features, the aluminum AVX1980 is so evolved it’s often mistaken as a hand-built fiberglass design. Built on a ground-breaking, high performance pad hull, this 19’ 10” rig enjoys a broad 95” beam, quick hole shots, responsive handling, and an exceptionally smooth ride. Inside, the 1980 is loaded with an equally impressive set of advantages. Smooth, stretch-formed gunnels deliver an advanced look and even more interior room. Likewise, the massive decks are inundated with storages so large they literally dwarf other aluminum designs. You’ll see it in the 8 ½ foot center rod locker, vast gear compartments, spacious rear power compartment, and the extra leg room at the console.</p><p>SeaStar™ Pro hydraulic steering centers the helm, complemented by a full array of electronics and instrumentation. Custom-contoured cockpit seating includes a choice of personalized configurations including a center storage box and step, folding center seat and step, or open step. An adjustable driver’s seat and remote drain plug control are also available. On the rear deck, the tournament-grade fiberglass livewell is engineered with recirculating aeration, auto fill valve (no leaky standpipe to set and remove), pump-out, and anti-splash ring. Further aft, our Vector Force™ transom is built to absorb the added shock and weight from today’s heavier outboards, shallow water anchors, and other stern-mounted gear.

Nautique  Super Air Nautique G23</h3><p>Building upon the dynasty that Nautique created almost a decade ago when the G23 was first introduced, the all-new G23 is set to reinforce its reign as the best wakesurf and wakeboard boat ever created. Our engineers have taken developmental leaps with the wake and wave shaping capabilities in order to produce this marvel of design and performance. With breathtaking looks and refined amenities, this next-generation G23 looks stunning on the water while delivering the best wakesurf wave and wakeboard wakes the world has ever seen. The reinvented G23 is ready to alter the course of wake boats once again.</p><p><strong>Features may include:</strong></p><strong>AGGRESSIVE STYLING ANDTIMELESS NAUTIQUE LOOKS</strong><p>A continuation of the signature Nautique aesthetic, the all-new G23 brings together the overall look and feel that the Ski Nautique and G23 Paragon have brought to the line-up. The faceted hull sides, aggressive styling and timeless Nautique looks also bring a load of appealing features.</p><strong>WINDSHIELD</strong><p>The completely redesigned G23 comes with a brand-new windshield to compliment it’s exterior aesthetic. Providing the driver with a clear view of their surroundings, this automotive-inspired windshield takes cues from the exterior of the G23 and continues those lines giving the entire boat a well thought-out, integrated look.</p><strong>BIMINI</strong><p>The bimini aboard the G23 is the perfect companion to those hot summer days. With surfboard storage on top, this bimini has utilitarian roots while complimenting the look and feel of the all-new G23. Wide coverage from the elements, utilize this option to keep your crew happy during a full day on the water.</p><strong>KEEPING EVERYTHING THEDRIVER NEEDS WITHIN REACH</strong><p>The all-new G23 takes on the asymmetrical design that Nautique has been on the forefront of and taken it one step further. Clear visibility of the water and the LINC Panoray touchscreen are evident, while keeping everything the driver needs within reach. A phone pocket doubles as a place to keep your drain plug when your boat is out of the water, and a large open dash area is the ideal place for hats and other accessories.</p><strong>BOW</strong><p>The bow of the G23 is an amazing place to spend a hot summer day. Two comfortable lounge seats with armrests on either side fill out the sides of the bow. Flip up the seats for a storage underneath and utilize the cupholders in various places around the bow. JL Audio® speakers keep the vibe alive in the bow as well, with it’s own zone for your lounging comfort.</p><strong>JL AUDIO® STEREO</strong><p>The Super Air Nautique G23 comes standard with the complete JL Audio M6 Series Elite stereo package with DSP technology. This includes the JL Audio MM100s head unit, 6 JL Audio M6 speakers throughout the boat, one 10” subwoofer and an 8-channel amplifier. Opt up to the Studio Elite package that includes two 12” subwoofers, the JL Audio Wavefront™ and a JL Audio Monoblock Amplifier.</p>\t\t\t
